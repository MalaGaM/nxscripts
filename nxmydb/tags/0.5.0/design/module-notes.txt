                      Notes For Writing User/Group Modules
                      ====================================

- If a write fails, ioFTPD automatically sets timer for a retry attempt. Pending
  locks are cancelled with error, and user/group file becomes read-only to
  ioFTPD until write succeeds.

- ioFTPD calls "Open" at the daemon initialization and "Close" on finalization.

- Lock request is always exclusive.

- Data within USERFILE structure is expected to be synchronized on "Lock".

- Modules may call "Update" routine to update cached values.

- Modules must not call any of the UserFile*/GroupFile* procedures, they may
  cause a dead-lock.

- UIDs and GIDs are unique to each site. On shared databases, handle resources
   by user names and group names.

- All requests may block for undetermined amount of time. However, consider
  anything that takes longer than few hundred milliseconds to execute as an
  invalid implementation.
