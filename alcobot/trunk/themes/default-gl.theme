# Control Identifiers:
#   [b]  - Bold code
#   [c]  - Colour code, followed by a colour index.
#   [c#] - Section colour code.
#   [o]  - Reset code.
#   [r]  - Reverse code.
#   [u]  - Underline code.
#
# Colour Index:
#   00 - White   04 - Light Red   08 - Yellow         12 - Light Blue
#   01 - Black   05 - Brown       09 - Light Green    13 - Pink
#   02 - Blue    06 - Purple      10 - Cyan           14 - Grey
#   03 - Green   07 - Orange      11 - Light Cyan     15 - Light Grey
#
# Variables:
#   %[width].[precision](variableName)
#   - All variable names are in camel casing (lower-case for the first word
#     and the first character of all subsequent words is capitalized).
#   - The 'width' and 'precision' fields work just as they do in the
#     C printf() function.
#
#### Colour
#
# Format : <section>,<number> = <colour>
# Example: APPS,1 = 03
#
# - The 'DEFAULT' entry is used if the announce is not section oriented
#   or there are no colours defined for the specific section.
# - The section colour identifier is '[c#]' (i.e. for 'APPS,2' the colour
#   identifier would be '[c2]').
# - There is no limit to the number of section colours you may define.
#
[Colour]
# Section colour one [c1].
